Designing two DC motors
to supply the robitic arm with movable base. we need to attach the base with wheels and supply them with DC motors.and to control the  arm remotly we need to control the electric signal that flow to the DC motors. the arm base only need to be supplied with motors in front wheel.So, in this task the robotic base designed to move in gigzag line using arduino UNO board and H brage IC chip.
